    <summary>AspUpload® is a server component that allows your web application to capture files uploaded with a browser in as little as 2 lines of ASP script.</summary>
    <description>With AspUpload, files up to 4 GB can be uploaded while only consuming a tiny amount of RAM on the server. The files can be uploaded to disk, memory or the database of your choice. The user can monitor upload progress and time-remaining information via a built-in HTML-based progress bar.</description>
